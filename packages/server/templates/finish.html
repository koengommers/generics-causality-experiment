    People often use sentences such as “Birds fly” to describe things they have learned about the world. We are investigating the conditions that make these statements true and the way people come to believe them. In particular, we are studying two hypotheses. First, that we learn those statements by comparing the group we want to describe with a relevant contrasting group: “Birds fly” is true because more species of birds fly compared to other animals. Second, that these statements make more sense when they are used to describe aspects of a group that are essential (or causal) to that group rather than being accidental.
